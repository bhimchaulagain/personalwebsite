&lt;p&gt;Epidemic invasion by newly introduced insectsâ€™ pests and pathogens pose serious threat to biodiversity, ecosystem function and human health worldwide, with socio-economic burden extensively larger than from natural disasters. Pathogens demonstrating long distance dispersal (LDD) are of more concern because of their ability to spread fast and remain cryptic (ability to stay asymptomatic for a certain period of time) as distant foci may have developed through surprisingly small concentrations of inoculum dispersed at larger spatial scales. I am conducting series of field studies to unlock the spatio-temporal spread and the efficacy of mitigation practices (e.g. timing and extent of fungicide applications and other broad-scale population protection) on epidemics caused by pathogens exhibiting long distance dispersal using wheat stripe rust as an experimental model. Results are validated using spatailly explicit SIR models with model parameteres relevant to wheat stripe rust.&lt;/p&gt;

Wheat culitvar mixtures (resistant and suceptible) can be used as a low cost method for suppressing many foliar diseases including wheat stripe rust. Series of field experiments conducted in Nepal suggested that there is positive correlation between the disease suppression and increased proportion of resistant cultivar in the mixture (My MS research project ðŸ˜„). Mechanism of disease suppression involves dilution effect, barrier effect, induced resistance and microclimate modification. Additionally, this approach can be integrated with chemical (strobilurin and triazoles) applications for better managment of the wheat stripe rust epidemics. More information on this can be found in one of our publication and several other literatures as well. Please follow this publication if you are interested in our research regarding the effect of wheat cultivar mixtures on wheat stripe ruust severity&lt;/p&gt;
