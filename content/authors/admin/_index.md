I am currently working on spatio-temporal spread and control strategies of infectious disease caused by long distance inoculum dispersal using wheat stripe rust as an experimental model. I have experiences and skills in small plot trial research, green house and growth chamber studies to characterize the efficacy, optimum frequency, and application timing of crop protection technologies (including fungicides) for the management of plant diseases. I am interested in plant disease epidemics modeling and ecology, characterization of crop protection technologies, disease resistance breeding and development of control strategies for plant disease epidemics management.
