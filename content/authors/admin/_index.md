I am currently working on spatio-temporal spread of wheat stripe rust. I have experiences and skills in small plot trial research, green house and growth chamber studies to test the efficacy, optimum frequency, and application timing of fungicides for the management of plant diseases. Additionally, I have experiences in plant disease modeling, and baseline simulations of plant disease epidemics and ecology. My postdoctoral research focuses on field studies of wheat stripe rust as an experimental model for testing effects of mitigation practices (e.g, reactive ring culling, chemotherapeutic applications, timing and extent of reactive ring treatments, and broad-scale population protection). This also involves the validation with a spatially explicit simulation model developed for wheat stripe rust.
  
  During my PhD, I developed sugarcane rust (brown rust and orange rust) prediction models using weather variables which could be used in predicting epidemics of sugarcane rust in Florida. I also evaluated biological activity and physical modes of action of several fungicides (strobilurin, carboxamide and triazole) in vitro and in situ for their efficacy to control sugarcane rust diseases.
